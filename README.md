## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Experimented a bit more with the form validation setup. Used a regex pattern mentioned on CSS Tricks site for hopefully better email patterning. I setup JavaScript to disable built-in form validation but will fallback if needed with less visual feedback experience.
